### Can you help with a translation? Contact me!

Now more than in previous versions a translation will help users. Translations are easier than ever to create and will add to the home assistant community.

Create a PR, contact me using the community link above, or raise and issue on GitHub, [tutorial](https://github.com/petergridge/Irrigation-V5/blob/main/translate.md).

#### German, Spanish, French, Italian, Dutch, Norwegian, Polish and Portuguese translations are now available.

## Experiencing issues with the custom card?

Enable the manual card yaml feature in the advanced setting of the program. This provides the yaml to recreate the custom card as an entities card.

* The script is regenerated each time the configuration is modified.
* Copy the script to a manual card and save.
  You will now have the equivalent of the custom card.

# Overview

The driver for this project is to provide an easy-to-use interface for the gardener of the house. The goal is that once the initial configuration is done all the features can be modified using the custom lovelace card.

The [start time](#what-time-will-the-program-start) can be based on sunrise, sunset, single or multiple times.

Watering can occur in an [ECO mode](#what-is-eco-mode) where a water/wait/repeat cycle is run to minimise run off by letting water soak in using several short watering cycles.

Supports watering by [time or volume](#Time-v-Volume).

A number of sensor inputs can be configured to stop or modify the watering based on external inputs.

* The [rain sensor](#rain-sensor-feature), this requires a binary sensor and can be defined at the zone level to allow for covered areas to continue watering while exposed areas are suspended.
* Water source sensor can be used to ensure that a well has water or stop watering when the well sensor is off.
* [Water adjustment](#what-do-sensors-do) provides for a factor to be applied to the watering time/volume either increasing or decreasing watering based on external inputs.

  * The [OpenWeatherMap History](https://github.com/petergridge/openweathermaphistory) component provides sensors that may be useful, this provides history and forecast weather information to allow you to expose sensors that can be used.

The program issues Home Assistant [events](#events) so you can undertake other automations if required.

There is also support for a [pump or master solenoid](#Pump-or-master-solenoid) and running [programs](#Concurrent-programs) sequentially or concurrently.

The included [custom card](#custom-card) renders the program configuration as a card and is installed automatically.


# Installation[üîù](https://github.com/petergridge/Irrigation-V5/blob/main/readme_new.md#Content)

### HACS installation

* Adding the repository using HACS is the simplest approach. The Custom Card deployed with the component, no need to install separately.
* look for IrrigationProgram Custom Component

<img width="277" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/065f9d00-c223-4112-8158-22e1bdae0633">


### Config Flow

* Define the program using the UI. From Setting, Devices \& Services choose 'ADD INTEGRATION'. Search for Irrigation Controller Component.
* Add the integration many times if you want more than one program.
* Modify programs and zones, add new zones, delete zones

### Basic Configuration

All entities to support the features are created automatically. You only need to provide the switches, valves for zones and pumps and external sensors that provide information to the system.

### Test configuration

[testhelpers.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petergridge/Irrigation-V5/main/testhelpers.yaml) provides the configuration to support all the objects for three zones. A set of template switches for the zones and pump as well as inputs to emulate rain and flow sensors.

This allows you to test the program without triggering any 'real' solenoids and will allow you to mimic your configuration in new versions to ensure an operational configuration after coming out your winter hibernation.

Be aware this is a simulation, variations in latency or behaviour of individual implementations will have an impact.

### Diagnostics

Diagnostic information can be downloaded from the integration menu
<img width="615" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d9ba4f7-d86e-46b5-a3d6-8962070fd49d">

# Important information[üîù](https://github.com/petergridge/Irrigation-V5/blob/main/readme_new.md#Content)

### Switch State

The component relies on accurate switch state information. Some hardware does not update the state of a switch when it turns on or off this can cause unexpected results. The program will attempt to manage these issues.


# Features[üîù](https://github.com/petergridge/Irrigation-V5/blob/main/readme_new.md#Content)

This section provides details of how the program operates.

### Are Rain Bird controllers supported?

Controllers supported by the [Rain Bird](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/rainbird/) Home Assistant integration are supported. The RainBird API will be used to start the zones bypassing the default runtime limitation. There have been reports of issues with the Rain Bird implementation not updating the state of the switch in some circumstances. This will result in a notification indicating a latency problem. This has been noted when using a negative zone transition value.

### Are B-Hyve controllers supported?

Controllers supported by the [Orbit B-Hyve](https://github.com/sebr/bhyve-home-assistant) from HACS are supported. The B-HYVEAPI will be used to start the zones bypassing the default runtime limitation. There may be issues with using a negative zone transition values.

### What time will the program start?

Four options are available to configure the start time. These can be selected from the [Advanced option](#advanced-options) menu in the configuration.

* Selector

  * Provides a time selector to input the scheduled start time.

* Multi time

  * Provides a text input to enter multiple start times for a program, for example 6am and 6pm

* Sunrise

  * calculates the start time based on the sunrise time provided by the sun integration. A slider provides the ability to offset the time by +/- 4 hours

* Sunset

  * calculates the start time based on the sunset time provided by the sun integration. A slider provides the ability to offset the time by +/- 4 hours

### When will the program run?

The schedule can be configured to:

* To run every 'n' days, 1 = every day, 2 = every two days and so on.
* On specific week days, 'Sun, Tue, Thu' will run the program on Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday only.

The schedule can be set at:

* The program level to apply to all zones.
* On each zone. This allows the program to run different zones at varying tempos allowing the lawn to be watered weekly and the pots every 2.
* A combination of both, if both are set the zone level frequency is used.



Automate the watering season using inbuilt [calendar funtionality](https://github.com/petergridge/Irrigation-V5/blob/main/automate_watering_season.md) to enable/disable the program.

### What will stop a program or zone while it is running?

* When the program is disabled all zones will stop.
* When the zone is disabled the zone will stop.
* When the water source (well) sensor is no longer active.
* The rain sensor will stop a currently running program, [advanced options](#advanced-options) support running completion.

### Why don't changes in the rain sensor and adjustment impact running zones

* Some users have soil sensors to determine the adjustment. If this sensor modified the operation of the zone it would impact the watering time adversely.
* When the rain sensor activates during a watering cycle it is optional for the program to continue until completed.

### What will stop the program initiating?

* When the Program is disabled (off)
* When all zones are disabled

### What will disable a zone?

* When it is disabled (off)
* When the rain sensor is active (on)
* When the adjustment value is zero (0)
* When the water source (well) sensor is inactive (off)

### Can I bypass the sensors?

* Ignore sensors

  * This will ignore the state of the Rain Sensor
  * Adjustment will default to one (1)
  * Water source sensor will be ignored

### What is zone transition?

The zone transition sets the overlap or wait time between zones. This can be used to manage 'hammering' when zones stop and start, or support occasions where your solenoid requires back pressure to operate effectively. A slider allowing +/- 10 seconds is provided.

### Pause a program.

You can pause and resume a program from the custom card or programmatically. When paused the running zone will be turned off and the remaining program suspended until the program is resumed.

There is an example of automating the pause feature [here](https://github.com/petergridge/Irrigation-V5/blob/main/pause.md)

### What do the sensors do?

Several sensors can be defined

* A rain sensor can be defined on each zone if active this will prevent the zone activating. [Advanced options](#advanced-options) are available to allow a running program to complete.
* Water source or well sensor, if inactive it will prevent any activation and stop running zones after a 5 second delay.
* Adjustment, this sensor is expected to provide a factor greater than or equal to 0, this is a multiplier applied to the watering time/volume. Use this to adjust the amount of water applied, less on rainy days, more on hot days. If the value is 0 the zone will not run.

### Can multiple zones run at the same time?

You can set the degree of parallel run in the program configuration. A value of 1 will result in the zones running sequentially. A value of 2 will let two zones run simultaneously the practical limit is the water pressure and number of sprinklers in your zones.

You can also create a switch group using HomeAssistant helper functionality. A group set up this way will allow multiple zones to be treated as a single switch. All the grouped switches will have the same run profile/duration.

### Can two programs run at the same time.

You can configure multiple programs to run together, by default if program executions overlap the second program will terminate the active one. This can be disabled in the advance options of the configuration. The setting must be updated on each program instance.

### Time v Volume

* Watering can be controlled using time
* If you have a calibrated flow sensor water can be measured by volume. If flow falls to zero for longer than 5 seconds the zone will stop.

### Pump or master solenoid

You can define a pump or master solenoid to be triggered with each zone. This valve will remain on for 5 seconds between zones to limit unnecessary cycling of the pump.

### What is ECO mode?

Configuring ECO mode on a zone will provision the wait and repeat options. This is used to limit run off by allowing for multiple short watering cycles to encourage the water to penetrate the soil. Ideal for pot plants.

### Next run behaviour

The next run is set from the start time and frequency provided. Changing the start time forward will initialise a new run even if it has already run on that day.

### Last ran

This is set after any successful completion of the zone. All zones triggered together will have the same last ran value set.

### Events

The following events are raised by this component and could be used to trigger other actions when the irrigation program is processed.

#### Program events

1. Fired when the program is turned on

```
  event\\\_data = {
      "action": "program\\\_turned\\\_on",
      "device\\\_id": entity\\\_id,
      "scheduled": True/False,
      "program": name,
  }
```

2. Fired when the program is turned off

```
  event\\\_data = {
    "action": "program\\\_turned\\\_off",
    "device\\\_id": entity\\\_id,
    "program": name,
  }
```

#### Zone events

1. fired when the switch is not reporting 'OFF' after being turned off.

```
  event\\\_data = {
    "action": "error",
    "error": "Switch can not be confirmed as OFF",
    "device\\\_id": entity\\\_id,
    "scheduled": True/False,
    "program": name,
  }
```

2. fired when the switch is not reporting ON after being turned on.

```
  event\\\_data = {
    "action": "error",
    "error": "Switch cannot be confirmed as ON",
    "device\\\_id": entity\\\_id,
    "scheduled": True/False,
    "program": name,
  }
```

3. Reported when rain is detected with settings that will stop the program

```
  event\\\_data = {
    "action": "error",
    "error": "Rain has been detected",
    "device\\\_id": entity\\\_id,
    "scheduled": True/False,
    "program": name,
  }
```

4. Fired when the water source is reporting no water is available

```
  event\\\_data = {
    "action": "error",
    "error": "No water source detected",
    "device\\\_id": entity\\\_id,
    "scheduled": True/False,
    "program": name,
  }
```

5. Fired when a solenoid is turned on

```
  event\\\_data = {
    "action": "zone\\\_turned\\\_on",
    "device\\\_id": solenoid,
    "pump": pump,
    "scheduled": True/False,
    "zone": name,
    "runtime": remaining\\\_time,
    "water": water,
    "wait": wait,
    "repeat": repeat,
  }
```

6. Fired when a solenoid is turned off

```
  event\\\_data = {
    "action": "zone\\\_turned\\\_off",
    "device\\\_id": solenoid,
    "zone": name,
    "state": state,
  }
```

7. Fired when an unexpected status is reported continuously for the latency check period while the solenoid is on

```
  event\\\_data = {
    "action": "error",
    "error": "Returned an unexpected state",
    "device\\\_id": entity\\\_id,
    "scheduled": True/False,
    "program": name,
    "state":  status
  }
```

8. Fired when the flow sensor continuously reports 0 flow for the latency check period

```
  event\\\_data = {
    "action": "error",
    "error": "No flow detected",
    "device\\\_id": entity\\\_id,
    "scheduled": True/False,
    "program": name,
  }
```

An automation can then use this data to fire on the event you can refine it by adding specific event data.

``` yaml
alias: irrigation\\\_program\\\_starts
description: "do something when the program is initiated on schedule, not manually"
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event\\\_type: irrigation\\\_event
    event\\\_data:
      action: program\\\_turned\\\_on
      scheduled: true
action: ---- Put your action here ----
mode: single
```

# Configuration[üîù](https://github.com/petergridge/Irrigation-V5/blob/main/readme_new.md#Content)

The configuration of the program initiates the creation of supporting helper entities that enable scheduling you irrigation system.

The most basic implementation only requires:

* The program name
* zone switch
  All supporting entities are created for you.

## Program definition

### Name

The name you enter for the program is used to generate a recognisable switch entity that is the foundation of the component.

### Program wide frequency

Selecting this provides the frequency of operation for all zones that do not have a zone frequency option defined. If you do not select this a zone frequency will be automatically created for each zone.

### Frequency options

The options selected/created here are used across the program and zone frequency selectors and supports:

* Numeric values: 1 = every day, 2 = every second day and so on.
* Day of week: valid values are Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun. When a day is selected the program will only execute the defined day.
* Days of the week: Enter combinations of days `Wed, Sat`. When selected the program will run on Wednesday and Saturday. This supports specific water restriction is some jurisdictions.

üìù You can extend this by entering your own frequency options for example Mon, Wed, Fri. New groups can only be made up of days of the week.

### Controller type

Selecting the RainBird controller this will result in the RainBird API being used to start the zones bypassing the default runtime limitation.

Uses the rainbird.start\_irrigation action to run for a specific period see: [Rain Bird](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/rainbird/)

### Pump

Defining the Pump valve/switch supports the control of a pump or master solenoid.
üìù Only open and close commands are supported for the valve implementation. Position based valves are not supported.

### Flow sensor

When defined the system operates on the delivery of volume rather than watering for a specified time.

* The flow sensor is monitored to determine the volume of water delivered and varies the watering time dynamically.
* If the flow sensor value is 0, the zone will terminate after 5 seconds.
* The ignore senor feature has no impact on this sensor.

### Water Source

This expects a true/false binary sensor input. Used to monitor a well status and prevent watering if the water drops below a certain level. Watering will be stopped if this sensor is activated.

* When the ignore senor feature is active, treats this value as true.



## Zone Definition

### Zone Group

You can optionally configure multiple solenoids to activate concurrently.

* Create a switch group, group helper. This feature allows you to group switches to operate as a single switch.
* All solenoids will operate for the same time.
* You can use this 'new' switch/valve to define a zone.

### Zone

The Valve or Switch that is exposed in home assistant to operate the irrigation solenoid.
üìù Only open and close commands are supported for the valve implementation. Position based valves are not supported.

### Zone Frequency

Specifying the Zone frequency option will provide the ability for a zone to have an independent frequency from the rest of the program. For example, pot plants can be watered daily but lawns every three days in a single program definition.
üìù The frequency options are defined in the program configuration.

### ECO feature

Selecting the ECO feature will provide the Wait/Repeat options to support multiple short watering cycles to limit the runoff. Particularly useful to allow water to penetrate pot plants.

### Watering Type

When a flow meter is assigned to the program this options allows you to set if the watering will be completed using volume or time based calculation for watering time.

### Adjustment Sensor

This expects a numeric sensor, input value greater than or equal to 0.

The value is multiplied against the watering time/volume.

* If there has been rain or rain is expected. Reduce the water time with a value < 1.
* Or if a hot spell is expected, increase the watering requirement with a value > 1.
* When the ignore senor option is active, treats this value as 1.
  üí°Check out [OpenWeatherMap History](https://github.com/petergridge/openweathermaphistory)

  * This exposes weather data to support the creation of sensors that can be used for this feature.

#### Using Smart Irrigation - Evapotranspiration watering time calculation.

While you cannot set the watering time directly from another sensor this is a workaround to allow the use of this custom component, https://jeroenterheerdt.github.io/HAsmartirrigation/ available in HACS.

* In the advanced options set the watering unit to seconds:
* Set the adjustment sensor to the Smart Irrigation sensor that provides the watering time for the zone.
* In the zone set the watering time to 1s.

Now when the zone runs the watering time (1) will be multiplied by the Smart Irrigation value to provide the actual run time in seconds.

### Rain Sensor

This expects a true/false binary sensor input. If the value is True, the zone will be suspended and the zone status indication updated.

* When the ignore senor feature is active, treats this value as false.
* [Advanced options](#advanced-options) allows selecting the behaviour when the program is already running:

  * Stop: the program will stop after a short delay, a persistent notification is created to highlight the occurrence
  * Continue: the program will continue to completion

### Zone Order

Use this to alter the run sequence of the zones. The value increments by 10 as a default to support easier redefinition of the sort order.



## Advanced options

### Concurrent program execution (interlock)

This option allows or prevents two programs executing concurrently.

* On - turn off other programs when starting, turn off when another program starts
* Off - Allow programs to run concurrently

Note this should be set consistently on every program.

### Start time options

Select an option to change the method that the start time is defined.
Options available:

* Time selector, supporting the selection of a single start time for the program
* Multi start, provides a text input that accepts multiple start times for example 08:00:00,18:00:00 to run at 6am and 6pm.
* Sunrise, this provides the base start time of sunrise with an option to offset the time using a numeric slider
* Sunset, this provides the base start time of sunset with an option to offset the time using a numeric slider

Sunrise and sunset are obtained from the SUN integration.

### Rain sensor behaviour

Allows selecting the behaviour when the program is already running:

* Stop: the program will stop after a short delay
* Continue: the program will continue to completion

### Maximum watering time/step

These options change the default settings for the slider to enter time/volume in the custom card.

### Maximum zone transition delay

Sets the max interzone delay displayed on the card

### Wait time for slow responding devices

Some devices are slow to update this sets the wait time before the program cancels

### Wait time for devices that are slow to start

Similar to above, this a one off wait time as the program starts to wait for devices to connect to HA.

### Lead/lag time for pump start

This option support the pump starting before or after the zone.

* A positive value will open zone solenoids prior to the pump.
* A negative value will open the zone solenoids after the pump has started.

### Zone parallel execution

This setting allows multiple zones to run concurrently in a program. if set to two, two zones will start and as one finishes another will start. If this setting is selected the zone transition is not available.

### Entities Card yaml generation

This setting enables the production of yaml to implement the equivalent to the custom card. Some users are experiencing issues with the custom card requiring this alternative. The custom card is also based on the entities cards.
The yaml is generated on start and when a program configuration is created or modified.
Insert the generated yaml into a Manual Card.

### Pause program when the water source sensor is indicating no water

This option will pause the program until the water source sensor indicates there is water available again.

### Delay next run when rain detected

Enables a delay function to add a number of days before the next run of the program. This feature is designed to be manually enabled, it is not related to the rain sensor.

If you want to delay the start of the program for a number of days after the rain sensor has turn on try this template binary sensor to replace the rain sensor.

``` yaml
{% set rain\\\_delay = 1 -%}
{{(as\\\_timestamp(now()) - as\\\_timestamp(states.binary\\\_sensor.rain.last\\\_changed | default(0)) | int )/3600/24}}
{% if states('binary\\\_sensor.rain') == 'off' %}
  {% if (as\\\_timestamp(now()) - as\\\_timestamp(states.binary\\\_sensor.rain.last\\\_changed | default(0)) | int )/3600/24 > rain\\\_delay %}
    off
  {% else -%}
    on
  {% endif -%}
{% else -%}
  on
{% endif -%}
```

* During latency check, start solenoid with each 1 second cycle, could assist with zigbee devices
* allow adjustment of latency constant
* add option to create a rain delay

  * adds n days to the frequency initiated.
  * extends the calculated next run by n days, i.e. from last ran date
  * behaviour

    * when turned on adds the selected number of days to the calculated next run
    * turns off when the program runs
    * can be turned off.
    * applies to all zones of the program
      implementation
    * Switch to turn off and on
    * input number to set delay
    * option to enable in advanced features

### V2025.05.02

* Fix lag on stopping programs, prevent program being started until it has completely stopped (1-2 seconds)

### V2025.05.01

* Handle duration longer than 24 hours. If duration is > 24 hours the remaining time will be 23:59:59 until the remaining time reduces
* Update Dutch translation
* Update max transition time to 120 seconds
* Make wait time seconds based when runtime is defined as seconds
* Fix code to stop the creation of the custom card yaml on start

### V2025.04.01

* Add Dutch translations
* Add support for B-Hyve (Beta)
* Change remaining time from Duration to Date, renders sensor as h:mm:ss now.

### V2024.12.01

**Breaking Change**

* Recommend removing and re-adding the configuration
* Removed capability to set frequency via a sensor
* Helpers defined to support start time, frequency, config... are no longer required
* Remove controller monitor functionality
* Custom card refined

A significant redevelopment

* Updated documentation
* New start time options
* Internalised the frequency capability
* All entities that previously required helpers are now created (and cleaned up) automatically
* Functionality is updated and reflects the documentation
* Ignore sensor functions operates on Well, Rain and Adjustment sensors
* Remove controller monitor functionality
* Add persistent notifications when the program is terminated as a result of sensor input.

### V2024.10.xx

* Manage entity register when zone is deleted
* Fix run frequency issues

### V2024.09.xx

* Reorder zones in the config flow
* Modify the listing config action to include values of the items
* Support sensor for start time, for example the sun sensor to start a program at dawn.
* Support +/- inter zone delay (delay between zone/overlap of zones)
* Improve start/stop processing of zones while a program is running, if a zone is started while a program is running it will be appended to the run.
* Add translation for status values in the card
* Add French translation
* Support for Valve objects - Open/Close only, Position not supported
* Refactor datetime usage for a more consistent approach
* Fix system monitor notification
* Update to hass.config\_entries.async\_forward\_entry\_setups
